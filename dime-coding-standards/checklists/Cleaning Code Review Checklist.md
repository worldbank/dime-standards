### **Reviewer Details**

> **Note:** Please complete this checklist **only if** the submission includes **cleaning** tasks.



### **Data Cleaning Tasks**

This checklist highlights key aspects to review in your partnerâ€™s **cleaning scripts/code**.  
Once completed, please submit it as an attachment along with [this form](https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/code_review_summary?caseid=).



### **General Cleaning Checks**
- [ ] Cleaning scripts do not create indicators (this should be done in a separate construction script).  
- [ ] Any changes made to specific values are well-documented and justified.



### **Duplicate Checks**
- [ ] The code checks for duplicates in ID variables and other key variables.  
- [ ] All identified duplicates are either resolved in the code or justified with an explanation.  
- [ ] The method used to resolve duplicates is stable, meaning it does not randomly drop duplicates but instead systematically identifies and tags specific observations.



### **Data Type Checks**
- [ ] The dataset contains string variables only where necessary, such as open-ended responses, proper nouns (not used as categories), or alphanumeric IDs.  
- [ ] All categorical string variables are converted into labeled categorical variables or factors.



### **Labeling Checks**
- [ ] All variables have clear and correct labels.  
- [ ] Value labels are consistent (e.g., avoiding cases where varA: 1 = yes, 0 = no, but varB: 1 = yes, 2 = no).



### **Missing Value Checks**
- [ ] Missing values are coded consistently.  
- [ ] Extended missing values are used where applicable (e.g., `.d` for **Do not know**, `.r` for **Refuse to answer**, etc.).



### **Merge Checks**
- [ ] If any observations are dropped, a clear justification is provided in the code.  
- [ ] Any mismatches between datasets are explicitly explained in the code.  
- [ ] `m:m` merge is **NOT** performed.



### **Clean Dataset Checks**
- [ ] The clean dataset is saved only once throughout the script and is not overwritten multiple times.  
- [ ] The clean dataset has unique values for the designated ID variable.
