# DIME Research Reproducibility Standards

All research outputs from DIME projects are required to be fully [reproducible](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/what-development-economists-talk-about-when-they-talk-about-reproducibility).
Analytical code must be released publicly.
The source of data used for any analytical product must be indicated,
either through a data citation or inclusion of data in the reproducibility package.
Analytical work must also be confirmed to be reproducible before being published.

The purpose is to ensure that
researchers do not have to answer basic questions
about how indicators are constructed or whether their calculations are correct.
It ensures that consumers of reserach can check these things for themselves,
as well as test simple variations on the processes
or [re-use code](https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/making-analytics-reusable)
for similar work of their own.
Many journals now enforce such standards at publication time,
and one version of those standards can be found on the
[AEA Data Editor website](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/).
More general standards are provided in the [Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines](https://cos.io/top/).

The DIME Research Reproducibility Standards are intended
to ensure that any work published by DIME researchers
is (a) unlikely to have significant changes to results after release
due to technical issues in the analytical code;
and (b) is prepared to meet these requirements for transparency in publication
both as a working paper and at any journal which later accepts the work.

At a minimum, this means that code must be submitted to
a **computational reproducibility check** organized by DIME Analytics
before publication as a working paper or submission to a journal.
This reproducibility check is initiated by filling out [this form](https://survey.wb.surveycto.com/collect/prwp_reproducibility?caseid=).
The team will review the submitted materials and provide results in a timely fashion.

In addition to these formal requirements for reproducibility review,
DIME projects should adhere to several additional best practices
to ensure that code is maintained continuously at high quality.
These practices must include:

- Ensuring that project code is organized with a master script
so that computational reproducibility is a one-click exercise
- Using GitHub.com to [document project work](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-github-trainings) and pull requests, and keeping the master branch
up-to-date as a working edition
- Participation of Research Assistants in quarterly peer code review rounds

Please contact DIME Analytics if you have any questions
or would like additional support in implementing these practices.
