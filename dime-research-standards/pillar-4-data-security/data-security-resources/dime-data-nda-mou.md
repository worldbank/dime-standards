# DIME RA/FC Non-Disclosure MOU
<br>

I, ________________________________ [print name of Research Assistant/ Field Coordinator], have agreed to maintain full confidentiality when contributing to research projects at DIME, (DECIE, The World Bank Group). 


## PART 1

By signing this document, I acknowledge my responsibilities to:


1. Keep all research information shared with me confidential. Therefore, I have committed to not discussing or sharing any information in any form or format (e.g., files, drives, transcripts, photos) with anyone outside the research team (as defined by the Principal investigator), and to only share information outside the research team if specifically requested to do so in writing by the Principal Investigator;

2. Hold in strictest confidence the identity or identifying information of any individual that may be revealed while performing the research tasks;

3. Not make copies of any non-published data in any form or format (e.g., drives, tapes, transcripts), unless specifically requested to do so by the Principal Investigator;

4. Keep all data that contains identifying information in any form or format (e.g., files, drives, tapes, transcripts) secure while it is in my possession. This includes:
    - keeping all digitized data in securely encrypted files;
    - password-protecting my computer and any other digital devices I use;
    - never transferring identifying information over e-mail;
    - signing out from or locking the computer containing identifying information when away from the computer, no matter how temporarily;
    - using headphones or a private setting if transcribing recordings;

5. Return all data in any form or format (e.g., drives, transcripts, photos) to the primary investigator when I have completed the research tasks, or at the end of my contract;

6. Destroy all research information in any form or format that is not returnable to the Principal Investigator (e.g., information stored on my computer hard drive) upon completion of the research tasks, or at the end of my contract, after I have made sure that the Principal Investigar have copies of all the data that I have local copies of.

## PART 2

By signing this document, I confirm that I understand the Letter of Appointment I have already signed, which stipulates that:

1. “All intellectual property rights in or relating to any works produced during the course of your appointment shall belong to the World Bank”
2. “All materials produced or acquired under terms of this contract - written, graphic, film, magnetic tape, or otherwise - shall remain the property of the World Bank unless such rights are explicitly relinquished by the World Bank, in writing”
3. “The World Bank retains the exclusive right to publish or disseminate in all languages reports arising from such materials.”

Meaning that I, under no circumstances, will publish any data or any result based on not-yet-published data or information from my research project except at the express request of the Principal Investigator.

## PART 3

By signing this document, I confirm that I have read the [DIME Analytics Data Security Guidelines](https://github.com/worldank/dime-standards/blob/master/DIME-Research-Standards/Research-Data-Security/DIME-Data-Security-Guidelines.md) and passed the assessment. I agree that I will follow those Guidelines in all my research tasks at DIME. I also understand that it is my responsibility to stay updated on DIME Analytics Data Security Guideline and that I am personally responsible for any data breaches resulting from failure to following those guidelines; and that I must report any violation of those guidelines immediately to the primary investigator.

I also confirm that it is my responsibility to follow up with DIME Analytics (dimeanalytics@worldbank.org) if there is any part of this agreement that I do not fully understand.
