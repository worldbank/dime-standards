# DIME Research Ethics Standards

## Ethics approval

**Researchers must identify and secure ethics approval**, from an institutional review board (IRB) and the appropriate local authority, for studies directly involving **human subjects** or the use of **personally-identifying information**.
- As the World Bank does not have an IRB, we recommend seeking approval from IRBs of partnered institutions, such as the universities with which external PIs are affiliated.
- If none of the research team members has an institutional IRB affiliation, the research team should use an accredited IRB for independent researchers, such as [Western IRB](http://wirb.com/Pages/IRBServices.aspx).
- IRB approval must be reported through the myIE monitoring system. Funding for the i2i and ieConnect Trust Funds requires documentation of IRB approval annually.
- Impact evaluations that do not involve human subjects or personally-identifying information, such as evaluations relying purely on de-identified secondary data, may be exempted from this requirement.
- The table below summarizes the international IRB and local ethics approvals required for each case

|     Type of project   |        International IRB     | Local IRB* |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| World Bank financed projects with external researchers involved    | IRB affiliated to external researchers |  Required based on country guidelines|
|  World Bank financed projects without external researchers involved     |    Private IRB   |  Required based on country guidelines  |
| Client financed projects with external researchers involved  |     IRB affiliated to external researchers |   Defined by country and client guidelines   |
| Client financed projects without external researchers involved  |     Private IRB |   Defined by country and client guidelines  |

_ * Local/In-country IRB information varies by a lot between countries and it is essential to try and find this information through local sources in most cases.Please reach out to DIME Analytics who can try to support obtaining information/contacts in the country. _

## Human Subjects Research Certification
**All research team members that handle personally identifiable information must have up to date Human Subjects Research Certification.**
- DIME-affiliated research team members may obtain the certification through DIME's [PHRP](https://phrptraining.com/) subscription. To do so, please email DIME Analytics.

## Confidentiality
Researchers must ensure confidentiality, privacy, and anonymity of study participants. Research team members are personally liable for any disclosure of confidential data that may occur due to their actions.
- All research assistants, field coordinators, and other consultants or interns affiliated with the research team must sign [DIME's Non-Disclosure Agreement](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/blob/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-4-data-security/data-security-resources/dime-data-nda-mou.md).
- All research teams must follow [DIME's Data Security Standards](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-4-data-security) when dealing with personally-identifiable and other confidential data.
- Direct identifiers must be removed from working data sets as early in the research process as possible.
- Only team members listed in the IRB may access confidential information.

## Informed consent
Study participants must have the opportunity to provide informed consent.
- All data collection instruments must start with an informed consent statement. The statement must be approved by the IRB.
- The DIME templates for Informed Consent is available in the [Research Ethics Resources folder](https://github.com/worldbank/dime-standards/tree/master/dime-research-standards/pillar-1-research-ethics/research-ethics-resources).
